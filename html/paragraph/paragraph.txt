	The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph.
	A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.
	Example:
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	<body>
	<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
	<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
	<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
	</body>
	</html>
